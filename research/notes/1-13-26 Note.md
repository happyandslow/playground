This document surveys **academic work that models LLM or agent memory as a materialized view**, or that is *structurally equivalent* to materialized views from database systems.  
The focus is **inference-time memory**, not training-time learning.

---

## 1. Conceptual Framing: Memory as a Materialized View

In databases, a **materialized view** is:
> A persisted, precomputed representation of query results, maintained over time to avoid recomputation.

In LLM systems, this corresponds to:
- Persisted summaries, reflections, or structured knowledge
- Maintained across turns / episodes
- Queried or injected at inference time
- Updated incrementally

A rare *explicit* invocation of this analogy appears here:

- **Jay Chia (Daft AI)** – *Knowledge Curation, LLMs, and Materialized Views*  
  https://www.daft.ai/blog/knowledge-curation-llms-materialized-views  

This blog explicitly frames LLM memory as a **knowledge materialization layer** that sits between raw data and inference, arguing that repeated synthesis without persistence leads to inconsistency.

---

## 2. Summarization-Based Memory (Canonical “Materialized View” Pattern)

### 2.1 Recursive / Incremental Summarization

These works explicitly **materialize conversation state** as a maintained summary.

- **Wang et al., 2023** – *Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15022  

Key ideas:
- Maintain a rolling summary of dialogue
- Update summary incrementally as new turns arrive
- Treat the summary as authoritative long-term memory
- Avoid replaying full history

This is almost a textbook **view-maintenance** algorithm:


$Summary_{t+1} = f(Summary_{t}, New\_Interaction)$


---

### 2.2 Memoization via Summaries in Chat Systems

Related systems (often used as baselines):

- **Zhong et al., 2024** – *MemoryBank: Enhancing Large Language Models with Long-Term Memory*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10250  

- **Lu et al., 2023** – *MemoChat: Tuning LLMs for Multi-Session Conversations with Memory*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08239  

These treat summaries or extracted facts as **persisted memory objects**, but often lack strong update semantics (leading to staleness).

---

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Memory (View = Retrieved Subset)

Retrieval-based systems materialize a **query-dependent view** of memory.

### 3.1 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- **Lewis et al., 2020** – *Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401  

- **Guu et al., 2020** – *REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08909  

At inference:
- Memory = top-k retrieved documents
- View is recomputed per query
- No persistence unless combined with caching

---

### 3.2 kNN / Datastore-Augmented LMs

- **Khandelwal et al., 2020** – *Generalization through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Language Models*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00172  

- **Borgeaud et al., 2022** – *RETRO: Improving Language Models by Retrieving from Trillions of Tokens*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04426  

Here:
- External datastore = materialized corpus
- Inference-time retrieval = partial view
- Read-only but extremely scalable

---

## 4. Hierarchical / OS-Inspired Memory (Paging = View Selection)

### 4.1 MemGPT (Explicit Systems Analogy)

- **Packer et al., 2023** – *MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560  

Key contributions:
- Context window = RAM
- External memory = disk
- LLM performs paging via tool calls
- Maintains a working-set view of memory

This is **explicitly inspired by OS memory management**, but conceptually equivalent to **cache-managed materialized views**.

---

### 4.2 Streaming / Memory Controllers

Related:
- **Liu et al., 2023** – *StreamingLLM*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453  

- **Sarthi et al., 2024** – KV-cache management for long-context inference

These manage **what portion of history is materialized into attention**.

---

## 5. Structured Memory = Materialized Knowledge Graph

### 5.1 Mem0

- **Chhikara et al., 2025** – *Mem0: Scalable Long-Term Memory for AI Agents*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16141  

Features:
- Extract facts from conversations
- Store in structured / graph-like memory
- Retrieve selectively
- Reduce token usage drastically

This is best viewed as:
> A continuously maintained **semantic materialized view** over agent experience.

---

### 5.2 A-Mem (Agentic Memory)

- **Xu et al., 2025** – *A-Mem: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01719  

Key ideas:
- Zettelkasten-inspired memory nodes
- Automatic linking and evolution
- Old memories updated when new context arrives

This corresponds to **incremental view maintenance over a self-evolving schema**.

---

## 6. Agent Memory via Reflection (View over Experience)

### 6.1 Reflexion

- **Shinn et al., 2023** – *Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366  

Memory consists of:
- Self-generated critiques
- Lessons learned
- Persisted textual state

Reflection memory acts as a **materialized policy improvement view**.

---

### 6.2 Generative Agents

- **Park et al., 2023** – *Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior*  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442  

Architecture:
- Raw episodic memory stream
- Periodic synthesis into reflections
- Retrieval based on relevance

This is a **multi-layer materialization pipeline**:


Experience → Episodic Memory → Reflective Summary → Action


---

## 7. Inference-Time Learning as Extreme Materialization

### 7.1 Test-Time Training / Context Distillation

- **Sun & Choi, 2026** – *Reimagining LLM Memory* (NVIDIA Blog)  
  https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/reimagining-llm-memory/  

Idea:
- Compress long context into weights at inference
- Memory lookup becomes O(1)
- Requires meta-training

This can be viewed as **materializing context into parameters**.

---

## 8. Database Community Perspective

- **CIDR / VLDB Workshops on LLMs & Databases (2024–2025)**  
  Example:  
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02098  

These explicitly call out:
- LLM memory as caching
- View maintenance as a missing abstraction
- Opportunities for DB-style optimizers in agent memory

---

## 9. Synthesis: Taxonomy

| Memory Type | Materialized View Analogy |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Dialogue summary | Incrementally maintained view |
| Retrieval (RAG) | Query-dependent view |
| KV cache | Ephemeral view |
| MemGPT | Cache-managed view |
| Knowledge graph | Structured materialized view |
| Reflection | Policy/experience view |
| Test-time training | View compiled into parameters |

---

## 10. Why This Matters (Research Angle)

Framing agent memory as a **materialized view** enables:
- Formal update semantics
- Staleness detection
- Consistency guarantees
- Cost-based memory selection
- Unification with DB systems theory

This framing is still **underexplored explicitly in academic papers**, making it a strong positioning angle for systems + LLM research.
